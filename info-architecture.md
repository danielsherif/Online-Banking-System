# Online Banking System - Architecture Documentation

## Current State Analysis

### Project Structure

The current project is organized into separate modules by team members:

- `login_loan-Daniel/`: Login, signup, and loan management
- `accounts-Rahma/`: Account management and transactions
- `CC-Karim/`: Credit card management
- `notis-Dina/`: Notifications system
- `report_pay-Youssef/`: Reports and payments

### Current Issues

1. **Code Organization**

   - Disconnected modules with no clear integration
   - Duplicate code across files (especially in JS files)
   - Inconsistent file naming and structure
   - Mixed concerns in single files

2. **Technical Debt**

   - Outdated frontend practices
   - No proper state management
   - Inconsistent styling approach
   - No type safety
   - No testing infrastructure

3. **User Experience**
   - Basic UI with limited interactivity
   - No responsive design patterns
   - Limited accessibility features
   - No proper form validation
   - No loading states or error handling

## Proposed Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier

## UI Preservation & Visual Consistency

- The unified app preserves the original look and feel of the legacy modules.
- All original HTML structure, CSS, and assets are retained for each module.
- Webflow-specific branding and comments have been removed for a clean, professional appearance.
- Screenshots of the main modules are included in the documentation for reference and visual QA.
- Navigation and routing are unified, ensuring a single entry point and seamless transitions between modules.
